# Cucumber

This is the parent repository for Cucumber.

The purpose of this repository is to document aspects that are common to all official Cucumber
implementations for various platforms.

There is no code in this repository, only issues/tickets and documentation.

Looking for a particular implementation? [look here](https://cucumber.io/docs#cucumber-implementations).

## Coming here soon: Monorepo with all Cucumber source code

All significant cucumber projects and libraries will soon be moved into this repository.
Each project/library will have its subtree mirrored as a standalone read-only repository, managed
by [splitsh-lite](https://github.com/splitsh/lite).

Here are a couple of quick and excellent introductions to monorepos, in case you are unfamiliar with them:
